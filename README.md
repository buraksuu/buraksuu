# 🚀 Hey, I'm Burak!

I am a Penetration Tester working on Web, Mobile, API, Internal, External, and Wireless security testing, focusing on identifying real-world security risks across diverse environments. I perform vulnerability assessments aligned with BDDK, SPK, and PCI-DSS, and deliver clear, evidence-based reports with actionable remediation guidance. Alongside my professional work, I solve CTF challenges involving vulnerabilities such as Use-After-Free, Double Free, OOB R/W, Heap Overflows, Race Conditions, and Integer Overflows, analyzing binaries with tools like IDA, Ghidra, and GDB. I also explore AI-assisted offensive tooling, integrating MCP-based workflows to automate reconnaissance, accelerate analysis, and enhance red-team efficiency.
