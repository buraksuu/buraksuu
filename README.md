# 🚀 Hey, I'm Burak!

I am a Penetration Tester in Web, Mobile, API, Internal/External and Wireless security assessments. I identify vulnerabilities, develop exploits and deliver comprehensive reports aligned with BDDK, SPK and PCI-DSS standards.

Experienced in binary exploitation—analyzing UAF and Buffer Overflow vulnerabilities using IDA, Ghidra, and GDB. Currently researching AI-assisted offensive tooling and MCP-based automation to enhance Red Team operations and offensive security capabilities.
