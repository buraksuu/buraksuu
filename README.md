# 🚀 Hey, I'm Burak!

I am a penetration tester working on Web, Mobile, API, Internal, External, and Wireless security testing, focusing on identifying real-world security risks across diverse environments. I perform vulnerability assessments aligned with BDDK, SPK and PCI-DSS and deliver clear, evidence-based reports with actionable remediation guidance. With my interest in binary exploitation, analyzing critical vulnerabilities such as Heap Overflow, Integer Overflow, and Out-of-Bounds (OOB), conducting reverse engineering using IDA, Ghidra, and GDB. I translate my theoretical knowledge into practical solutions in CTF labs involving complex scenarios. In addition to my core testing expertise, I research AI-assisted offensive tooling by integrating MCP-based workflows. By automating reconnaissance and accelerating deep analysis, I aim to enhance Red Team efficiency and develop innovative approaches to modern security challenges.
